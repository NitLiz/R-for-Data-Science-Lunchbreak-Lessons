# The tidyverse in 5 minutes

# be sure to check out Charlie Joey Hadley's Learning the R Tidyverse in this library

# The Tidyverse is a set of packages that enhance the R programming language
# with a unique workflow based on piping results through a set of filters.
# Everything that can be done with the Tidyverse can also be done with Base R,
# but many programmers find it easier to write and understand code using
# Tidyverse constructs

# 1) The Tidyverse makes it easy to add, move and delete statements 2) Tidyverse
# isn't an immediate panacea to R. You still need to learn commands and how to
# use them. 3) Tidyverse does clean up most of the conversions between data
# types expressed by functions.
