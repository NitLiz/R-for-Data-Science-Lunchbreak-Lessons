# Description: Example file for aggregate

# main idea: aggregate is R for SQL "group by"

# grab some data to work with
data("ChickWeight")

# let's say I want the median weight of each chick
# basic format
aggregate(ChickWeight$weight,  by=list(chkID = ChickWeight$Chick), FUN=median)
aggregate(ChickWeight$weight,  by=list(chkID = ChickWeight$Diet), FUN=median)
# notice it isn't sorted

# use ~ notation
# ~ is for modeling. Left of ~ is "y". Right is model. so y ~ model
# in other words, left of ~ is the result. right of ~ are selectors
aggregate(weight ~ Chick, data=ChickWeight, median)

# list() behaves differently than "~". median needs numeric data
aggregate(weight ~ Chick + Diet, data=ChickWeight, median) # this works

# this doesn't. But it should. Factors don't work with median.
aggregate(x=ChickWeight, 
          by=list(ChickID = ChickWeight$Chick, Dietary=ChickWeight$Diet), 
          median)

# convert factors to numeric
str(fixedChickWeight)
fixedChickWeight <- ChickWeight # make a copy of ChickWeight
fixedChickWeight$Chick <- as.numeric(levels(ChickWeight$Chick)[ChickWeight$Chick])
fixedChickWeight$Diet <- as.numeric(levels(ChickWeight$Diet)[ChickWeight$Diet])
str(fixedChickWeight)

#now this works
aggregate(x=fixedChickWeight, 
          by=list(ChickID = fixedChickWeight$Chick, Dietary=fixedChickWeight$Diet), 
          median)
